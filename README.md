Longhorn Manager [![Build Status](https://drone.rancher.io/api/badges/rancher/longhorn-manager/status.svg)](https://drone.rancher.io/rancher/longhorn-manager)
========

Manager for Longhorn.

## Requirement

1. Existing Kubernetes Cluster 1.8+
2. Make sure `iscsiadm`/`open-iscsi` has been installed on the host.
3. Make sure `jq`, `findmnt`, `curl` has been installed on the host, for the Longhorn Flexvolume Driver.

## Build

`make`

## Deployment

`kubectl create -Rf deploy`

It will deploy the following components in the `longhorn-system` namespace:
1. Longhorn Manager
2. Longhorn Flexvolume Driver for Kubernetes
3. Longhorn UI

## Cleanup

`kubectl delete -Rf deploy`

## Integration test

See [longhorn-tests repo](https://github.com/rancher/longhorn-tests/tree/master/manager/integration)

## Notes:

### Google Kubernetes Engine
You will need to create cluster-admin role binding for yourselves before creating the deployment, see
[here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control) for details.
```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<name@example.com>
```

### Flexvolume Plugin Directory
By default we're using the [default Flexvolume Plugin directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/flexvolume.md#prerequisites), which is `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/`.

For GKE 1.8+, it should be at: `/home/kubernetes/flexvolume`.

You may need to change `deploy/deploy.yaml` volume `flexvolume-longhorn-mount` location according to your own environment.
